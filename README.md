## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- A code text editor (We like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- [Expo Tools](https://expo.io/tools) - CLI or XDE (We prefer the [XDE](https://github.com/expo/xde) but it does take up more space on your hard drive)
- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

```
Give examples
